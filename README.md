1. def find_cube_pairs(target)  
   - Missing colon (:) at the end.  
   - Fix: def find_cube_pairs(target):  

2. solutions = [];  
   - No error, but unnecessary semicolon (;) can be removed.

3. max_num = round(targ *** (1/3))  
   - targ is undefined (should be target).  
   - *** is incorrect for exponentiation (should be **).  
   - Fix: max_num = round(target ** (1/3))  

4. for a in ranges(1, max_num + 1)  
   - ranges() does not exist in Python (should be range()).  
   - Missing colon (:) at the end.  
   - Fix: for a in range(1, max_num + 1):  

5. for b in ranges(a, max_num + 1)  
   - ranges() does not exist in Python (should be range()).  
   - Missing colon (:) at the end.  
   - Fix: for b in range(a, max_num + 1):  

6. if a***3 + b***3 == targ  
   - *** is incorrect for exponentiation (** should be used).  
   - targ is undefined (should be target).  
   - Missing colon (:) at the end.  
   - Fix: if a**3 + b**3 == target:  

7. sol.append((a, b));  
   - sol is undefined (should be solutions).  
   - Unnecessary semicolon (;).  
   - Fix: solutions.append((a, b))  

8. return sol  
   - sol is undefined (should be solutions).  
   - Fix: return solutions  

9. pairs = find_cube_pairs(1729),  
   - Comma (,) at the end is incorrect (should be removed).  
   - Fix: pairs = find_cube_pairs(1729)  

10. printf("Valid cube pairs for 1728:"),  
    - printf() is incorrect in Python (should be print()).  
    - Unnecessary comma (,).  
    - Fix: print("Valid cube pairs for 1728:")  

11. for a, b in pair  
    - pair is undefined (should be pairs).  
    - Missing colon (:) at the end.  
    - Fix: for a, b in pairs:  

12. printf(f" → {a}³ + {b}³ = {a**2} + {b**2} = 1728")  
    - printf() is incorrect (should be print()).  
    - Wrong exponentiation (a**2 and b**2 should be a**3 and b**3).  
    - Fix: print(f" → {a}³ + {b}³ = {a**3} + {b**3} = 1728")
